permalink: /publications/PD_EEG_paper
excerpt: "Detecting Parkinson's Disease in its early stages using EEG data presents a significant challenge. This paper introduces a novel approach, representing EEG data as a 15-variate series of bandpower and peak frequency values/coefficients. The hypothesis is that this representation captures essential information from the noisy EEG signal, improving disease detection. Statistical features extracted from this representation are utilised as input for interpretable machine learning models, specifically Decision Tree and AdaBoost classifiers. Our classification pipeline is deployed within our proposed framework which enables high-importance data types and brain regions for classification to be identified. Interestingly, our analysis reveals that while there is no significant regional importance, the N1 sleep data type exhibits statistically significant predictive power (p < 0.01) for early-stage Parkinson's Disease classification. AdaBoost classifiers trained on the N1 data type consistently outperform baseline models, achieving over 80% accuracy and recall. Our classification pipeline statistically significantly outperforms baseline models indicating that the model has acquired useful information. Paired with the interpretability (ability to view feature importance's) of our pipeline this enables us to generate meaningful insights into the classification of early stage Parkinson's with our N1 models. In Future, these models could be deployed in the real world - the results presented in this paper indicate that more than 3 in 4 early-stage Parkinson's cases would be captured with our pipeline."

Firstly, we present a novel representation for EEG data, a 7-variate series of band power coefficients, which enables the use of (previously inaccessible) time series classification methods. Specifically, we implement the multi-resolution representation-based time series classification method MrSQL. This is deployed on a challenging early-stage Parkinson's dataset that includes wakeful and sleep EEG. Initial results are promising with over 90% accuracy achieved on all EEG data types used. Secondly, we present a framework that enables high-importance data types and brain regions for classification to be identified. Using our framework, we find that, across different EEG data types, it is the Prefrontal brain region that has the most predictive power for the presence of Parkinson's Disease. This outperformance was statistically significant versus ten of the twelve other brain regions (not significant versus adjacent Left Frontal and Right Frontal regions). The Prefrontal region of the brain is important for higher-order cognitive processes and our results align with studies that have shown neural dysfunction in the prefrontal cortex in Parkinson's Disease.classification method MrSQL.
