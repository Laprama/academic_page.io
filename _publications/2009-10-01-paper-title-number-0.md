excerpt: 'We use Electroencephalography (EEG) data to detect early stage Parkinson’s Disease. Firstly, we present a novel representation for EEG data, a 7-variate series of band power coefficients, which enables the use of (previously inaccessible) time series classification methods. Our approach achieves over 90% accuracy, recall and precision which rivals state of the art methods. This is particularly impressive given the early stage Parkinson’s Disease participants and limited optimisation of the model thus far. Secondly we present a framework for determining the importance of individual brain regions in Parkinson’s Disease classification. We find that across different EEG data types, it is the Prefrontal brain region that has the most predictive power for the presence of Parkinson’s DiseaseWe use Electroencephalography (EEG) data to detect early stage Parkinson’s Disease.

Firstly, we present a novel representation for EEG data, a 7-variate series of band power coefficients, which enables the use of (previously inaccessible) time series classification methods. Specifically, we implement the multi-resolution representation-based time series classification method MrSQL. This is deployed on a challenging early-stage Parkinson's dataset that includes wakeful and sleep EEG. Initial results are promising with over 90% accuracy achieved on all EEG data types used. Secondly, we present a framework that enables high-importance data types and brain regions for classification to be identified. Using our framework, we find that, across different EEG data types, it is the Prefrontal brain region that has the most predictive power for the presence of Parkinson's Disease. This outperformance was statistically significant versus ten of the twelve other brain regions (not significant versus adjacent Left Frontal and Right Frontal regions). The Prefrontal region of the brain is important for higher-order cognitive processes and our results align with studies that have shown neural dysfunction in the prefrontal cortex in Parkinson's Disease.classification method MrSQL.
