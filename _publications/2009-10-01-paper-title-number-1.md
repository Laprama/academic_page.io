This paper is about  Electroencephalography (EEG) data to detect early stage Parkinsonâ€™s Disease. We present a novel representation for the EEG data as a 7-variate series of band power coefficients which enables the use of previously inaccessible time series classification methods. We also provide a framework for determining brain region importance in disease classification. Our method achieves high performance (95% accuracy) and finds the Prefrontal region of the brain most discriminative in Parkinson's classification. Please read the [preprint paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09568) for more information on this work! This work will be presented at the AAAI Health Intelligence Workshop and published in the Springer Book Series 'Studies in Computational Intelligence'. 

I'm currently working on a number of extensions to this paper that include the use of additional signal statistics (entropy, coheerence between brain regions), improving the explainability of our classifier and extending the analysis to include patients with REM Sleep Behaviour Disorder (RBD). Patients with RBD often go on to develop Parkinson's Disease but this progression is poorly understood.
